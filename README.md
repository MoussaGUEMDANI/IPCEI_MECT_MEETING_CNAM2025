## Repository Clone

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/MoussaGUEMDANI/IPCEI_MECT_MEETING_CNAM2025.git
```

## Hardware Requirements

1. Networking equipment (Ethernet cables, switches, etc.)
2. COTS host machines (for CU/DU and 5G Core) (TBD)
3. N77 band-compatible antennas
4. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) 5G/NR UEs
5. USRP X310 SDR (with UBX daughterboards)

## Software Prerequisites

## What do we cover in the demo?

The aim of this tutorial is to demo:

1. Deployment of an end-to-end 5G/NR Standalone (SA) setup using srsRAN and OAI with USRP X310 and COTS UEs on band N77.
2. Real-time monitoring and comparison of system performance (throughput, latency, jitter, CPU usage, etc.).
3. MAC Scheduler and PHY layer PRB allocation (to discuss) 

## Estimated Demo Replication Time
~xx mins (subject to environment setup)
